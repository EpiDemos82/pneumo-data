## Data

* Table S4 Additional strain information for beta-lactam suscep- tible and non-susceptible phenotypes for the Maela dataset. Susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion with oxacillin (1 mg oxacillin disk zone diameter of ,20 mm). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined by E-test if disk diffusion test indicated potential penicillin non-susceptibility [20].
* Strain names and a full list of MICs from the Maela dataset [20] are given in Table S4. Strains and metadata for the Massachusetts dataset were given as supplementary data in ref [21]
