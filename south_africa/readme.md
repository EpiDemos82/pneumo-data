## Data

* **Description:** Isolates were obtained through the GERMS-SA (Group for Enteric, Respiratory and Meningeal Disease Surveil- lance in South Africa) network, which conducts active, national, laboratory-based surveillance for IPD. Surveil-
* **Reads**:
	* Accession numbers for encapsulated S. pneumoniae used for cps locus alignment are in Additional file 3.
	* Accession numbers for encapsulated S. pneumoniae isolates from South Africa and carriage nontypeable isolates from other studies used to construct the phylogenetic tree are in Additional file 4.
* **Assemblies:** The draft genome sequences of the 39 NTPn isolates analysed in this study have been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers
