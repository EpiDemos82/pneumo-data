## Data

* The Massachusetts (616 genomes) assembled with Velvet
* The Maela (3,085 genomes) assembled with VelvetOptimiser
* Southampton (516 genomes) assembled with VelvetOptimiser
* Nijmegen (337 genomes) assembled with VelvetOptimiser

Remark: To standardise them relative to the Massachusetts dataset, assemblies were discarded if they were less than 1.98 Mb, or greater than 2.19 Mb, in length, or had an N50 less than 15 kb16,39, or necessary information was absent from the public databases.
